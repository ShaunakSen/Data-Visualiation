Motion path animations - setup a path for the animation to follow

Animations → Preview to preview the animations

Animation → effect options: some options regarding how the animation appears

Add animation → add multiple animations to an object

1, 2 on the object tells us the sequence of animations set on that object

You can click on the numbers to view the animation set

Trigger - u can set the animation to occur when u click on a specific object - use this to build buttons that initiate animations

The lightning icon indicates i have a trigger set on the second animation 

Animation painter → use this to copy animations to other shapes (double click on the painter button to persist it else it will reset everytime u copy over to one object)

Animation pane - use this to change the order of the animations - this also shows the timeline and animation triggers which is very useful!

We can also set the trigger of each animation to be on click/with prev/after prev

We can also set the duration, delay

We can also drag the bars on the animation pane to set duration and delay

### Animation pane - some advanced settings

Here there is an option called "Repeat"

Also there is an option called "Rewind when done playing", so if we have a motion path that goes from one side to the other, once the animation is done, we can reset it

### Advanced animation options

Animation pane → Effect options

There are a bunch of options  here - experiment with them

**Animating text**

Animations → emphasis → some animation icons have a text inside them, these are for text

We can also apply object level animations

For example we apply the fade in animation to the text box

But here we have bulleted text:

We want each item to have its own animation sequence, for example we might want the top level bullets to appear first

effect options → by paragraph

Also we can further customize all this from animation pane → effect options → text animation

Also in effect options → effect there is "Animate text" option - here we can select "Animate by letter" - quite cool!
