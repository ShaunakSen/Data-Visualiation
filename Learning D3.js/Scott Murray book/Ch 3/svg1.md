## Basics of SVG

- If any visual elements run up against the edge of the svg it will be clipped
- path is used for drawing more complex shapes
- No concept of **depth** in SVG
- If we draw multiple shapes, they overlap (like applying paint on canvas). **This aspect of drawing becomes important when some elems must not be obscured by others. For eg: axes and labels should be added to SVG last, so that they appear in front**
- The coords of the shapes are defined within the current svg elems only
