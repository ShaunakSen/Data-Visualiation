                Bubble chart to explore the generation metrics vs capacity for different countries

              <p>
              In this bubble chart we wish to explore how <code>Estimated generation (in gwh)</code>
                changes with respect to <code>Capacity (in mw)</code> for different countries.
                We also want to represent the information of <code>generation (in gwh) for the year 2015</code>                
              </p>
              <p>
                For generating the visualization I have filtered for the following condition:
                <code>capacity > 0 and estimated_generation_gwh > 0 and generation_gwh_2015 > 0</code>

                  In the above Bubble Chart the X axis represents the <code>Capacity of thr plant (in mw)</code> The Y axis represents the <code>Estimated generation (in gwh)</code>
                  The color of each circle represents a <code>country</code>. The size (area) of the bubble refers proportionally to the <code>generation (in gwh) for 2015</code>
                </p>
                <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
                    The first filter is a multiple-select dropdown where users can select the countries they want to view that data for
                </p>
                <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
                  The other two filters are sliders by which users can set a minimum threshold for <code>capacity and estimated generation</code>
                  The chart has a lot of data points in the region <code>capacity < 1000 and estimated_generation < 4000</code> So these filters will help the user
                  view and explore specific portions of the chart 
                </p>
                <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
                  Users can hover over specific bubbles to view more information about the plants
                </p>
                <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
                    I have used a color-blind friendly palette for the chart generated from <a href="https://coolors.co/">this source</a>

                    Additionally there is an option for a dark theme for the visualization to 
                    help users who perceive contrast better
                </p>
                <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
                    While animating in or out of the chart, all bubbles do not appear or disappear at the same time. They do so with a delay which helps the user perceive
                    which bubble came from where and not lose perspective.
                </p>
                <p class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">
                    From the plot one can easily understand the trend between <code>capacity and estimated generation</code>.
                    Most plants with low capacity tend to have low estimated generation and also low generation value for 2015.
                    Plants of India are of low capacity but have high values of estimated generation (even though the generation for 2015 was low)
                    Most of the larger bubbles are towards the right of the chart which further illustrates the trend
